       "  'textb': \"what are the symptoms of covid19?the most common symptoms of covid19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. 1/3what is a coronavirus?coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  in humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers, sars and now, covid19.what is covid19?covid19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. 2/3older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. people with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.3/3how does covid19 spread?people can catch covid19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid19 coughs or exhales. 1/3these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. 2/3people can also catch covid19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.3/3can the virus that causes covid19 be transmitted through the air?studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.can covid19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. the risk of catching covid19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. 1/2however, many people with covid19 experience only mild symptoms. this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. it is therefore possible to catch covid19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  2/2\",\n",

       "  'textb': 'human populations are not wellmixed &amp; homogenous, so calcs give likely upper bound. q: so what is herd immunity threshold (hit) for real pops?a: *usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.background: if we know reproductive number r0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (hit) for wellmixed homogenous population is simply 11/r0. (note r0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).1) if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering hit. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).2) if some aren\\'t susceptible to infection that reduces hit. 3)if some people don\\'t transmit that also reduces hit.positive correlations among these traits  if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious  can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.however, see paper by  that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than science paper cited above. fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects hit, f, for r0=3; so hit=0.66, f = 0.94.science paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit. it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.the strange part is that it\\'s not clear what source their agemixing data comes from. the citation they give is not a published paper  it\\'s a link to a page w/ matlab files. it\\'s weird because there are several agemixing datasets out there.  can probably provide best onesthe take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. not wellmixed) and w/ arbitrary differential \"activity\" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce hit for r0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43.the conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value.what i find puzzling is that this paper is in science. it\\'s a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. it isn\\'t as general as  paper cited above, and it\\'s not clear it has any new empirical data. many older papers say same thing.paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on hit, f based on data (colored lines in figure).in idealized population, early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak b/c rt=r0*s/n so rt&lt;1. however, an epidemic will overshoot hit &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1exp((f*r0)). for r0=2.5 (reasonable for covid19 in some pops), hit=0.6, and f = 0.89.these simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led  to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 4070% of pop would get infected without interventions. most articles cited the 70% *but*  knew that...i\\'d like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity &amp; some are very indirect estimates, but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial. but ...serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger, or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f (~20%  i added horiz dashed line).together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is &lt;11/r0 and epidemic overshoot &lt;f=1exp((f*r0)), but by how much is still unknown. ugh.  smartly gave a wide range 4070% (2060% in later interviews) for fraction infected f w/out interventions.unfortunately, uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does r0). the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection.are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups)?#covid19yes. see link at end to interview with  that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.did some work on this in 2007 or so also when i recall correctly: ‚Äú\"a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available.\"this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial).do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts?not yet, sadly!without reading: the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading.unroll pleasesalam, please find the unroll here: : what is #herdimmunity threshold for #covid19? a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp;‚Ä¶  talk to you soon. ü§ñ\"what is this about nerd immunity?\"assumptions about heterogeneity are just that, assumptions. but there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns; despite high levels of infection. thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict.',\n",

consideration needed to be taken. 2/2tim says \"we\\'re not trying to scare people. there\\'s a lot of bad information out there.\"he encourages people to get information only from reputable sources, instead of looking at things on facebook or from friends and spreading it like it\\'s a fact.\"we would encourage people to be patient because it\\'s a fluid situation.\"  feldshauhe notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week. however when advice was given to keep events small, the church went to live streaming.ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan. and several times a year, the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them.\"we are as prepared as we can be with the information we\\'re getting. of course it\\'s fluid, but we\\'re accustomed to these types of situations.\"reiterating a point made previous, people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions.she said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are \"doing very well.\"\"for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us.\"now talking about \"flattening the curve.\" people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections.\"this is not here today and gone tomorrow.\" feldschauulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would \"tax our healthcare system.\" should the city/county get there, it would have to look at \"alternative\" ways to treat people. she didn\\'t expand on what those alternatives are.she said that\\'s one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up.\"i we know that you\\'re coming, the staff can be ready for you. they can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that\\'s one way now we\\'re trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus.\" 2/2feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.\"if we ever lose control, we\\'re going to have a serious problem.\"from comment section on the video: \"if this virus is just like the flu &amp; spreads like viruses do (airborne) i‚Äôm not understanding the panic &amp; closure of so many things? what is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don‚Äôt do it for flu?\"this seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments. someone simply responded \"yassss\" and another said people don\\'t know what to do \"so they just shut everything down i guess.\"so even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ...',\n",

       "  'textb': 'how does covid19 spread?initially, experts believe the virus started out in animals in wuhan, china; and was then transmitted to humans. the current version of the sarscov2 spreads from persontoperson, similar to the flu. this usually happens when a sick person coughs orwhat is covid19?coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. they have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe middle east respiratory syndrome (merscov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sarscov).in december 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in wuhan, china.the virus was previously termed ‚Äúncov2019‚Äù. at the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named sarscov2, due to its similarities to the previoussarscov. the disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the who as coronavirus disease 2019, or ‚Äúcovid19‚Äù.sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters).what are the symptoms of covid19?symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. but in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. symptoms can include:‚Ä¢ fever‚Ä¢ cough‚Ä¢ trouble breathing ‚Ä¢ feeling tired‚Ä¢ muscle achesmost people have mild symptoms. some people have no symptoms at all. but in other people, covid19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.this is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.when should i see a doctor?if you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to covid19, call 937 (the saudi moh service center) immediately.you might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days:‚Ä¢ you lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus ‚Äì the united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has information about which areas are affected. this can be found on their website:  ncov/travelers/index.html‚Ä¢ you had close contact with a person who has the virus ‚Äì this generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.if your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. they can tell you what to do and where to go.if you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. the staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people.if you are severely ill and need to go to the clinic or hospital right away, you should still call ahead.this way the staff can care for you while taking steps to protect others.how is covid19 treated?most people with covid19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. if you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the \"icu\").there is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen(e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication.can covid19 be prevented?there are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting covid19:‚Ä¢ wash your hands with soap and water often. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going tothe bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.o if soap and water are not readily available, use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.‚Ä¢ avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands‚Ä¢ cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash yourhands immediately after (as specified above).‚Ä¢ clean and disinfect frequently touched objects andsurfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.‚Ä¢ cdc does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including covid19.o facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of covid19 tohelp prevent the spread of the disease to others. the use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has covid19.‚Ä¢ stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to covid 19.‚Ä¢ try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.‚Ä¢ some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of covid19.if someone in your home has covid19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:‚Ä¢ keep the sick person away from others ‚Äì the sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.‚Ä¢ use face masks ‚Äì the sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. if you are caring for the sick person,you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. this is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask.‚Ä¢ be extra careful around body fluids ‚Äì if you will be in contact with the sick person\\'s blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear adisposable face mask, gown, and gloves. if any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.‚Ä¢ clean often ‚Äì it\\'s especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. this includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets,and bathroom surfaces. also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.‚Ä¢ wash hands ‚Äì wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above)‚Ä¢ you should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding withother people or pets in your home. there is not yet a vaccine to prevent covid19.how can i prepare for a possible outbreak?it is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. the best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contactwith people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.if there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. if this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with covid19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.there are things you can do to prepare for this. for example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. you can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.this way you will be able to receive and share information easily.if you or others in your family are anxious about covid19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. while it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk.where can i learn more?as we learn more about this virus, expert recommendations will continue to change. check with your doctor or public health official to get the most updated information about how to protect yourself.you can also find more information about covid19 at thefollowing:‚Ä¢ united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc):‚Ä¢ world health organization (who): ‚Ä¢ the saudi ministry of health (moh): ‚Ä¢ saudi moh coronavirus service center number: 937‚Ä¢ saudi national ambulance hotline: 997',\n",

       "  'textb': 'q. can the virus that causes covid19 be transmitted through the air?a. studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindiaq. what is covid19?a. covid19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. this new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019.q. what are the symptoms of covid19?a. the most common symptoms of covid19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. #coronavirusq. how fatal is covid19?a. [1/3 ]most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.[2/3] older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. about 2% of people with the disease have died. #coronavirusoutbreak #coronavirusindiaq. how does covid19 spreads?a. [1/3] people can catch covid19 from others who have the virus. the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid19 coughs or exhales. #coronavirusupdates[2/3] these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. other people then catch covid19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. #coronaalert #coronavirus[3/3] people can also catch covid19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindiaq. can covid19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?a. [1/2] the risk of catching covid19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. but many people with covid19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.[2/2] it is therefore possible to catch covid19 from someone who might be infected but has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. #corona #coronavirusindia',\n",
